# insta-tags

Hello there!

These two little Python scripts randomly choose hashtags from your databases in a file with four dots in front of them (Instagram "format").

You have to put .txt files with yout hashtags in the folder "db" : it can be one file with random hashtags or multiple files with hashtags divided by theme (like in our example).
Once your databases created, you launch "config.py" to refresh your databases and to choose how many tags you want from each of your databases (don't panic, just follow instructions once the file is launched).
Then you launch the "insta-tags.py" and in the "random_tags.txt" you'll find your four dots

and your tags !

Enjoy !
